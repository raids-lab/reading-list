title = {A general persistent code caching framework for dynamic binary translation (DBT)},
year = {2016},
isbn = {9781931971300},
publisher = {USENIX Association},
address = {USA},
abstract = {Dynamic binary translation (DBT) translates binary code from one instruction set architecture (ISA) to another (same or different) ISA at runtime, which makes it very useful in many applications such as system virtualization, whole program analysis, system debugging, and system security. Many techniques have been proposed to improve the efficiency of DBT systems for long-running and loop-intensive applications. However, for applications with short running time or long-running but with few hot code regions such as JavaScript and C# applications in web services, such techniques have difficulty in amortizing the overhead incurred during binary translation.To reduce the translation overhead for such applications, this paper presents a general persistent code caching framework, which allows the reuse of translated binary code across different executions for the same or different applications. Compared to existing approaches, the proposed approach can seamlessly handle even dynamically generated code, which is very popular in script applications today. A prototype of the proposed framework has been implemented in an existing retargetable DBT system. Experimental results on a list of applications, including C/C++ and JavaScript, demonstrate that it can achieve 76.4\% performance improvement on average compared to the original DBT system without helper threads for dynamic binary translation, and 9\% performance improvement on average over the same DBT system with helper threads when code reuse is combined with help threads.},

abstract = {The recent transition in the software industry toward dynamically generated code poses a new challenge to existing dynamic binary translation (DBT) systems. A significant re-translation overhead could be introduced due to the maintenance of the consistency between the dynamically-generated guest code and the corresponding translated host code. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel approach to optimize DBT systems for guest applications with dynamically-generated code. The proposed approach can maximize the reuse of previously translated host code to mitigate the re-translation overhead. A prototype based on such an approach has been implemented on an existing DBT system HQEMU. Experimental results on a set of JavaScript applications show that it can achieve a 1.24X performance speedup on average compared to the original HQEMU.},

isbn = {9781509049318},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Speed, portability and correctness have traditionally been the main requirements for dynamic binary translation (DBT) systems. Given the increasing availability of multi-core machines as both emulation guests and hosts, scalability has emerged as an additional design objective. It has however been an elusive goal for two reasons: contention on common data structures such as the translation cache is difficult to avoid without hurting performance, and instruction set architecture (ISA) disparities between guest and host (such as mismatches in the memory consistency model and the semantics of atomic operations) can compromise correctness.   In this paper we address these challenges in a simple and memory-efficient way, demonstrating a multi-threaded DBT-based emulator that scales in an architecture-independent manner. Furthermore, we explore the trade-offs that exist when emulating atomic operations across ISAs, and present a novel approach for correct and scalable emulation of load-locked/store-conditional instructions based on hardware transactional memory (HTM). By adding around 1000 lines of code to QEMU, we demonstrate the scalability of both user-mode and full-system emulation on a 64-core x86_64 host running x86_64 guest code, and a 12-core, 96-thread POWER8 host running x86_64 and Aarch64 guest code.},
